# [Mind Your Buisness] üéØ

### Project Description

Mind Your Business AI is a fun web-based app that mimics the nosy behavior of typical Malayali relatives. When you type a personal update like ‚ÄúGot a job,‚Äù AI characters like Ammavan, Ammayi, Appooppan, and Ammu respond with sarcastic, judgmental comments in Malayalam+English, just like a family WhatsApp group. The cartoonish UI even lets you ‚ÄúSlap‚Äù or ‚ÄúElectrify‚Äù them for fun!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
 
When life feels a little *too* peaceful and stress-free, we bring in your classic Kerala relatives ‚Äî guaranteed to stir up drama and remind you of problems you never knew you had.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We‚Äôre solving the age-old problem of nosy relatives by giving you more of them ‚Äî but this time, they‚Äôre trapped inside a hilarious AI-powered WhatsApp-style chat! Instead of avoiding awkward questions at family functions, you can now get roasted safely online by Ammavan, Ammayi, Appooppan, and Ammu ‚Äî all in Manglish, with over-the-top drama and slap-worthy reactions. Because if you can‚Äôt escape the gossip, you might as well laugh at it! üòÑüî•
