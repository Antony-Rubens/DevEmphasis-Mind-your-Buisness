Project Description

Mind Your Business AI is a fun web-based app that mimics the nosy behavior of typical Malayali relatives. When you type a personal update like ‚ÄúGot a job,‚Äù AI characters like Ammavan, Ammayi, Appooppan, and Ammu respond with sarcastic, judgmental, compararision comments in Malayalam+English, just like a family WhatsApp group. 

The Problem (that doesn't exist)

When life feels a little too peaceful and stress-free, we bring in your classic Kerala relatives ‚Äî guaranteed to stir up drama and remind you of problems you never knew you had.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We‚Äôre solving the age-old problem of nosy relatives by giving you more of them ‚Äî but this time, they‚Äôre trapped inside a hilarious AI-powered WhatsApp-style chat! Instead of avoiding awkward questions at family functions, you can now get roasted safely online by Ammavan, Ammayi, Appooppan, and Ammu ‚Äî all in Manglish, with over-the-top drama and slap-worthy reactions. Because if you can‚Äôt escape the gossip, you might as well laugh at it!
